### 1. INTERPRETED LANGUAGE IS MORE PORTABLE AND FLEXIBLE THEN COMPILED LANGUAGES.
JAVASCRIPT IS AN INTERPRETED LANGUAGE.

INTERMIDATE LANGUAGE 50/50

Disadvantages of interpreted languages
The most notable disadvantage is typical execution speed compared to compiled languages.

In compiled languages, the target machine directly translates the program and excecuted. In interpreted languages, you need a .EXE (Excutable), in order to run and translate the code language.

## 2. compiler checks the syntax of our code, 
compilation is faster..
Interpreter executes the code, line by line, then is a bit slower..
but is platform independent.
